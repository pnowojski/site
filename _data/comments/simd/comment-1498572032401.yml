  Regarding C# ->The .NET JIT will currently never do any auto vectorization. 
  System.Numerics lets you do it by hand, and while it is a very convenient API
  (write SIMD once, works on different SIMD architectures) it is also very
  incomplete.  There are hundreds of SIMD intrinsics and .NET only supports a
  dozen or so. Important ones like shift and convert are missing.  Discussions
  are ongoing on how to add more.
